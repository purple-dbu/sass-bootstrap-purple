headlines
---------

Headlines have been changed to match the Purple web guideline:

> The Purple brand font is Helvetica Neue and consists of five weights: 35 Thin,
> 45 Light, 55 Roman, 65 Medium and 75 Bold.
> Arial is a standard system font used by browsers. Whilst the majority of text
> on an Purple site is HTML Arial, the page designs also occasionally use a
> graphical version of Helvetica Neue to reinforce the brand identity.
